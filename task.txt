Document >> Represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
Window >> Represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.

Document >> It is loaded inside the window.
Window >> It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.

Document >> syntax => document.propertyname;
Window >> syntax => window.propertyname;

Document >> Object of window property.
Window >> Object of the browser.

Document >> All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
Window >> Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.

Document >> We can access the document from a window using => window. document
Window >> We can access the window from the window only => window.window

Document >> The document is part of BOM (Browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
Window >> The window is part of BOM, not DOM.

Document >> Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, 
             etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
Window >> Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.

Document >> example : document.title ==> will return the title of the document
Window >> example : window.innerHeight ==> will return the height of the content area of the browser
